# Part 1 - What is SEO

---

## SEO in one sentence

SEO is the practice of improving a website so search engines can:

- find it (crawl)
- understand it (index)
- rank it for the right searches (rank)

Goal: match **user intent** with **useful content**.

---

## How search engines rank pages

Search engines consider hundreds of signals, but the big buckets are:

- relevance (does the page match the query?)
- quality (is the content helpful and trustworthy?)
- usability (is the site fast, clear, and easy to use?)

---

## Search intent (why people search)

Common intent types:

- **Informational:** learn something
- **Navigational:** find a specific site
- **Transactional:** buy or take action
- **Local:** near me / in a place

Matching intent is core to ranking.

---

## SEO is not a trick

Avoid shortcuts like:

- keyword stuffing
- hidden text
- duplicate or copied content

These hurt trust and ranking long term.

---

# Part 2 - Keywords and on-page SEO (6.1)

---

## Keyword basics

Keywords are the words people use when they search.

Your job is to:

- pick the right topics
- match how real people phrase searches
- place keywords naturally where they help understanding

---

## Where do keywords come from?

- Google autocomplete and related searches
- Search Console (what queries already drive traffic)
- Customer questions (support email, reviews, FAQs)
- Competitor pages (what they rank for)

---

## Map keywords to pages

Each important page should target:

- **one primary keyword** (main topic)
- **a few related keywords** (variations, synonyms)

Avoid using the same primary keyword on many pages.

---

## Strategic keyword placement

Best places to include the primary keyword:

- page title (title tag)
- H1 heading
- first 100 words of content
- subheadings (H2/H3)
- URL (short and clear)
- image alt text (when relevant)

---

## Title tag vs. H1

- **Title tag** shows in search results and browser tabs
- **H1** is the visible page headline

They should be similar, but not identical.

---

## Example: title + H1

Bad:

- Title: "Home"
- H1: "Welcome"

Better:

- Title: "Denver Wedding Photography - Bright Leaf Studio"
- H1: "Wedding Photography in Denver"

---

## Meta description (click-through)

Not a ranking factor, but influences clicks.

Good meta descriptions:

- summarize the page in 1-2 sentences
- include the primary keyword
- set a clear expectation

---

## On-page HTML example

```html
<title>Beginner Yoga Classes in Bloomington</title>
<h1>Beginner Yoga Classes in Bloomington</h1>
<p>Join small-group yoga classes designed for new students...</p>
<h2>Class schedule</h2>
<img src="studio.jpg" alt="Yoga studio in Bloomington" />
```

---

## Keyword best practices

- write for humans first
- use natural variations (not repetition)
- avoid stuffing in every sentence
- make sure the page actually answers the search

---

# Part 3 - Content quality (6.2)

---

## What makes content rank

Strong content is:

- **useful** (answers the question)
- **unique** (not copy/paste)
- **credible** (accurate, current)
- **scannable** (easy to read)

---

## Write for real people

Ask:

- What problem is the user trying to solve?
- What do they need to decide or do next?
- What examples would make this clearer?

---

## Content structure that works

Simple structure for most pages:

1. clear intro (what this page is)
2. subheadings that answer questions
3. examples, steps, or visuals
4. summary or next action

---

## Avoid thin content

Thin pages usually have:

- vague or generic text
- copied descriptions
- no unique value

Better: add specifics, examples, and context.

---

## Refresh and maintain

Search engines value freshness when it matters.

- update stats and dates
- fix broken links
- remove outdated info

---

# Part 4 - UX, navigation, and engagement (6.3)

---

## Why UX matters for SEO

Search engines watch user signals like:

- time on page
- bounce rate
- pages per session

Good UX keeps people engaged and signals quality.

---

## Navigation basics

Users should be able to:

- find key pages in 1-2 clicks
- understand where they are
- move between related pages

Use clear menus and consistent labels.

---

## Information architecture

Organize content by topic:

- broad category pages
- narrower subpages
- internal links between related pages

This also helps search engines discover pages.

---

## Layout and readability

Improve readability with:

- short paragraphs
- bullets and subheads
- visual hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- contrast and spacing

---

## Mobile-first mindset

Most traffic is mobile. Make sure:

- text is readable without zoom
- buttons are easy to tap
- menus are simple

---

## Site speed basics

Fast pages keep users and help ranking.

Quick wins:

- compress images
- avoid huge video files
- reduce unnecessary scripts

---

## Accessibility supports SEO

Accessibility helps users and search engines.

- semantic headings
- alt text for images
- descriptive link text

---

# Part 5 - Practical workflows

---

## SEO page checklist

- clear primary keyword
- title tag and H1 aligned
- meta description written
- headings organized
- internal links added
- images optimized with alt text
- content is unique and useful

---

## Key takeaways

- SEO is about relevance, quality, and usability
- Keywords guide structure, but content serves the user
- Clear navigation and good UX improve engagement and ranking
