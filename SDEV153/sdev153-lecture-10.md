# Part 1 - What is SEO

---

## SEO in one sentence

SEO is the practice of improving a website so search engines can:

- find it (crawl)
- understand it (index)
- rank it for the right searches (rank)

Goal: match **user intent** with **useful content**.

---

## How search works (and why it ranks pages)

Search engines:

- **crawl** pages, then **index** content (text, images, video)
- **serve** results based on ranking factors

Ranking factors (concepts):

- meaning of the query (intent)
- relevance of the page
- content quality
- usability
- context/settings (location, language, history)

---

## Search intent (why people search)

Common intent types:

- **Informational:** learn something
- **Navigational:** find a specific site
- **Transactional:** buy or take action
- **Local:** near me / in a place

Matching intent is core to ranking.

---

## SERPs and features (what shows up)

Search results can include:

- paid ads and organic listings
- featured snippet (answer box)
- rich results (ratings, price, availability)
- images, videos, local pack (map + listings)

The layout changes based on the query and intent.

---

## SEO is not a trick

Avoid shortcuts like:

- keyword stuffing
- hidden text
- duplicate or copied content

These hurt trust and ranking long term.

---

# Part 2 - Keywords and on-page SEO (6.1)

---

## Keyword basics

Keywords are the words people use when they search.

Your job is to:

- pick the right topics
- match how real people phrase searches
- place keywords naturally where they help understanding

---

## Where do keywords come from?

- Google autocomplete and related searches
- Search Console (what queries already drive traffic)
- Customer questions (support email, reviews, FAQs)
- Competitor pages (what they rank for)

---

## Keyword research (fast version)

Find how people _actually_ search:

- autocomplete and related searches
- customer questions and reviews
- Search Console queries
- competitor pages

Examples:

- couch vs. sofa vs. sectional
- "wedding photographer denver" vs. "denver wedding photos"

---

## Map + place keywords

Each important page should target:

- **one primary keyword**
- a few related variations

Place the primary keyword in:

- title tag, H1, first 100 words
- subheadings, URL, relevant alt text

---

## Titles, H1s, and meta descriptions

- **Title tag** shows in search results
- **H1** is the page headline
- **Meta description** drives clicks

Keep them aligned with the primary keyword.

---

## Keyword best practices (and what to avoid)

- write for humans first
- use natural variations
- do not keyword-stuff

Stuffing hurts trust, usability, and rankings.

---

# Part 3 - Content quality (6.2)

---

## What makes content rank

Strong content is:

- **useful** (answers the question)
- **unique** (not copy/paste)
- **credible** (accurate, current)
- **scannable** (easy to read)

---

## Write for real people

Ask:

- What problem is the user trying to solve?
- What do they need to decide or do next?
- What examples would make this clearer?

---

## Structure + freshness

Simple structure for most pages:

1. clear intro (what this page is)
2. subheadings that answer questions
3. examples, steps, or visuals
4. summary or next action

Avoid thin content (generic, copied, vague). Refresh when needed:

- update stats and dates
- fix broken links
- remove outdated info

---

# Part 4 - UX, navigation, and engagement (6.3)

---

## Why UX matters for SEO

Search engines watch user signals like:

- time on page
- bounce rate
- pages per session

Good UX keeps people engaged and signals quality.

---

## Navigation basics

Users should be able to:

- find key pages in 1-2 clicks
- understand where they are
- move between related pages

Use clear menus and consistent labels.

---

## Structure + crawlability

Keep the site easy to navigate and easy to crawl:

- clear hierarchy (category -> subpage -> detail)
- pages within 3-4 clicks of the homepage
- every page reachable via links

This helps both users and search engines.

---

## URLs + trust signals

- short, readable URLs with meaningful words
- helpful 404 page (links back + popular pages)
- HTTPS everywhere (security + trust)

Clean URLs can appear in search results.

---

## UX essentials (readability, mobile, speed, accessibility)

Quick wins that improve engagement and SEO:

- short paragraphs, clear headings, good contrast
- mobile-friendly text and tap targets
- faster pages (compress images, avoid heavy scripts)
- accessible content (semantic headings, alt text, descriptive links)

---

# Part 5 - Practical workflows

---

## SEO page checklist

- clear primary keyword
- title tag and H1 aligned
- meta description written
- headings organized
- internal links added
- images optimized with alt text
- content is unique and useful

## Key takeaways

- SEO is about relevance, quality, and usability
- Keywords guide structure, but content serves the user
- Clear navigation and good UX improve engagement and ranking
